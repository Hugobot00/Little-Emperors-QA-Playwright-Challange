# Test Automation Project Documentation

## Overview
This test automation project is designed to validate the functionalities of both a hotel management API and a web system's login functionality. It uses the Playwright framework to simulate user interactions and verify the correctness of API operations and web login processes.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used to write the tests.
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing framework for Node.js, used to simulate user interactions with the web and make HTTP requests to the API.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- **tests/**: Main directory for all test files.
  - **frontend_tests/**: Subdirectory with tests specific to the web system's login functionality.
    - **login.spec.js**: File that includes test scenarios for the login functionality.
      - The file `login.spec.js` contains three main tests:
        - Visit to the Login Page
        - Login with Correct Credentials
        - Login with Incorrect Credentials

  - **backend_tests/**: Subdirectory with tests specific to the hotel API.
    - **hotelModulation.spec.js**: File containing the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) tests for hotels.
      - The tests are contained in the file `hotelModulation.spec.js`, which includes two main scenarios:
        - Editing a Created Hotel
        - Deleting a Created Hotel

    - **auth.spec.js**: File that includes test scenarios for authentication.
      - The tests are contained in the file `auth.spec.js`, which includes two main scenarios:
        - Authentication with Valid Access
        - Authentication with Invalid Access

## Implemented Tests

### Frontend Tests
#### `login.spec.js`
1. **Visit to the Login Page**
   - **Description**: Checks if the login page is accessible.
   - **Expected Result**: The login page loads successfully.

2. **Login with Correct Credentials**
   - **Description**: Tests the login process using a set of valid credentials.
   - **Expected Result**: The login is successful, and the user is redirected to the home page or dashboard.

3. **Login with Incorrect Credentials**
   - **Description**: Tests the login process using a set of invalid credentials.
   - **Expected Result**: The login fails, and an error message is displayed to the user.

### Backend Tests
#### `hotelModulation.spec.js`
1. **Editing a Created Hotel**
   - **Description**: Tests the update of an existing hotel's data.
   - **Expected Result**: The API returns a 200 OK status.

2. **Deleting a Created Hotel**
   - **Description**: Tests the deletion of a hotel.
   - **Expected Result**: The API returns a 204 No Content status.

#### `auth.spec.js`
1. **Authentication with Valid Access**
   - **Description**: Tests the authentication process with valid access credentials.
   - **Expected Result**: The API returns a 200 OK status.

2. **Authentication with Invalid Access**
   - **Description**: Tests the authentication process with invalid access credentials.
   - **Expected Result**: The API returns a 401 Unauthorized status.
